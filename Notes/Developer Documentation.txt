# AI Resume Backend

Project Name: AI Resume Backend

## Workflow

### 1. Resume Upload
Files: server.py
Libraries: Flask, Werkzeug
How it works: Flask API endpoint receives PDF file upload
Example: POST /upload-resume with multipart/form-data

### 2. Text Extraction
Files: pdf/pdf_service.py
Libraries: PyPDF2
How it works: Opens PDF file and extracts text from each page
Example: "John Doe\nSoftware Engineer\nExperience: 5 years..."

### 3. NLP Processing
Files: nlp/nlp_service.py
Libraries: re (regex)
How it works: Uses regex patterns to extract skills and keywords
Example: Extracts "Python", "React", "AWS" from resume text

### 4. Embedding Generation
Files: nlp/embedding_service.py
Libraries: hashlib, random
How it works: Creates hash-based embeddings for text similarity
Example: Converts resume text to 384-dimensional vector [0.1, 0.2, ...]

### 5. Database Storage
Files: database/database_service.py
Libraries: sqlite3
How it works: Stores resume data and embeddings in SQLite database
Example: INSERT INTO resumes (id, text, embedding) VALUES (1, '...', '[...]')

### 6. ATS Scoring
Files: ats/ats_service.py
Libraries: math, re
How it works: Calculates scores based on format, skills, experience
Example: format_score: 85, skills_score: 90, experience_score: 75

### 7. Background Processing
Files: celery/celery_app.py, tasks.py
Libraries: Celery, Redis
How it works: Async task processing for heavy operations
Example: process_resume_background.delay(resume_id)

### 8. Job Matching
Files: job/job_service.py
Libraries: csv
How it works: Matches resume against job descriptions using embeddings
Example: Similarity score: 0.85 between resume and job posting

### 9. Results
Files: server.py
Libraries: Flask, jsonify
How it works: Returns JSON response with processed data
Example: {"resume_id": 1, "score": 85, "skills": ["Python", "React"]}
